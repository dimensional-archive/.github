> Old projects I'm not working on anymore.

## Support

I am not giving support for any of these projects.
However, you can join my server to talk to me!

###### [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/JrHfSmb)

## OSS

Just because these projects are open source doesn't mean you can outright take the code.
If any of the projects do **NOT** have a `LICENSE` file, these are the things you can do with the code:

- use it and provide credit to me, must be clear to the user.
- take inspiration to improve on the code, this does not mean you can just copy it.
- fix any issues that you find/experience, I am not liable for **ANYTHING** pertaining to the code in this org.
