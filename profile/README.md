> Old projects I'm not working on anymore.

## Support

I am not giving support for any of these projects.
However, you can join my server to talk to me!

###### [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/JrHfSmb)

## OSS

Just because these projects are open source doesn't mean you can outright take the code.
If any of the projects do **NOT** have a `LICENSE` file, you must abide by the following terms & conditions:

- take no credit for any of the code, must be clear to the user. this does not include any changes.
- you may only take inspiration or improve on the code (while still crediting me).
- i may not be held for **ANYTHING** pertaining to the code in this org (damages, loses, etc).
- it may not be used commercially.
